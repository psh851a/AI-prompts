For this blog post, we will walk you through several prompts to help you generate videos. Videos are unlike images, where you just describe a few details and you're done. Things can change frame by frame. The angles, the camera, the level of detail, the lights, scenes, sounds, there are just so many elements involved and moving parts working together to bring your ideas to life.

So, writing prompts for generating AI videos differs from creating prompts for images. If you use the wrong prompts, you won't get satisfactory results, and that's a big challenge. Here is a collection of prompts to start making great videos. We'll also tell you how to tweak them and make your own.

How Can I Make My AI Video Prompts More Unique?
So, let's say you're writing a prompt about a product. Instead of telling AI to generate a video for a generic product like a nutritional supplement, you can add more details about your product, like what it can do, what it looks like, the color, shape, size, texture, any health benefits, and what setting it is in.

You can share your thoughts and opinions on the product in your prompt, but you must break down those details into short sentences. Don't make them too long so that AI can understand you. The more you layer your info and the more detail you can make your prompt, the more customised it will be. That is often a good starting point. Also, if you feed AI any custom image references that can guide it, then you're on your way to correctly using the AI tool. When you make the video, it will be like something that's never been created before. YouTube or any platform won't care whether it's AI-generated at that point. That is how you do AI video prompting correctly.

Conclusion
Well, that's it. These are great examples of how you can prompt AI to generate videos for you. You can see some of these prompts are short and to the point. We've broken them down into chunks of sentences so that AI can digest. It's always a good idea not to write lengthy sentences. And if you're describing details, break them down into parts.

If you're looking for an image-to-image or text-to-video generator, you can try ModelsLabs. We have Imagen, Video Fusion, and 3D Verse for generating videos, images, animations, and 3D models from text prompts. Play around with these prompts, add details to your scene, experiment with lighting, and see what works for you. We are sure you'll get great results. Feel free to steal our prompts and use them to your liking. Comment below if you had a good time, and tell us what you did.
