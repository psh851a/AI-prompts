how to write prompt for stable diffusion video
🧠 Prompt Structure for Stable Diffusion Video
1. Subject: Who or what is the focus?
2. Action or Motion: What are they doing?
3. Environment: Where is it happening?
4. Style & Mood: Cinematic? Dreamy? Hyper-realistic?
5. Quality Tags: “masterpiece,” “high detail,” “4K,” etc.
6. Negative Prompts (optional): What do you want to avoid? (e.g., “blurry,” “low quality”)

🎬 Example Prompt
“A futuristic samurai walking through neon-lit Tokyo streets at night, rain falling, cinematic lighting, ultra-detailed, 4K, masterpiece”
Negative prompt: “blurry, distorted, low-res, extra limbs”


🔧 Tips for Better Results
- Use motion cues: “walking,” “spinning,” “zooming out,” “slow motion”
- Add camera directions: “drone shot,” “close-up,” “pan left”
- Be specific: Instead of “a man,” try “an elderly man in a trench coat holding a glowing orb”
- Use AnimateDiff or Deforum settings to control frame count, zoom, and motion interpolation
